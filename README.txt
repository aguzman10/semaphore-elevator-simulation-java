command line used to compile code:
	javac Project2.java

command line used to run code:
	java Project2

NOTE:
	For some reason my code does not run to completion when using the command line.  It starts to act weird, and does not run the code correctly, at least when I run on my laptop.
	If you run into this error, please run on Netbeans or some other IDE to prove my code works.  I will attach screenshots to my summary to show how my code acts when running on both
	my netbeans IDE and my command line.
